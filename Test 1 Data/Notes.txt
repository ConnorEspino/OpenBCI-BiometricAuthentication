The two directories contain all the Pre-Processed EEG data collected in various environments.
Initial Readings were done at least a week before Secondary Readings

Some data had to be thrown out while Pre-Processing:
	Throw out Split 3 of Reading 0 for Hector (Only decomposed 2 IMFs)

	Throw out Split 1 of Reading 2 for Justin (Only decomposed 2 IMFs)

	Throw out Split 1 of Reading 0 for Connor2 (Only decomposed 2 IMFs)
	Throw out Split 1 of Reading 2 for Connor2 (Only decomposed 2 IMFs)

	Throw out Split 0 of Reading 0 for Elliot2 (Only decomposed 2 IMFs)

	Throw out Split 1 of Reading 2 for Emerson2 (Only decomposed 2 IMFs)

	Throw out Split 2 of Reading 0 for Hector2 (Only decomposed 2 IMFs)
	Throw out Split 1 of Reading 1 for Hector2 (Only decomposed 2 IMFs)
	Throw out Split 2 of Reading 1 for Hector2 (Only decomposed 2 IMFs)

Most of the thrown out data is from the second readings. The data that wasn't from the second readings and thrown out came from when one of our ground ear clips was broken.
This leads us to believe that the lack of a reference ground pin is causing our data to be skewed, leading to incorrect authentication. 
This is also backed up by the IMFs themselves, having extremely volatile readings when not using the second reference clip

Individual accuracy and output for each user when ran against the model in Initial Readings is located in ./Secondary Readings/Participant/Classification Output.txt
